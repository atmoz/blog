# My first post

Hello world, my name is Adrian Dvergsdal, and this is my personal blog.

## Short background

I currently live in Bergen, Norway, where I work part-time as a
web developer and preparing for a degree in Computer Science. 
I'm interested in psychology, science, society, and all things
centered around improving humanity in general. I consider myself an activist,
and is active in a variety of non-profit organisations in my free time. That's
what passion do.

## Don't expect anything fancy

I assume you know the concept of blogging, so will spare you the story. What I
can say is that you should not have too many expectations -- I sure ain't.
Expectations kill creativity you know. When blogging you should write what you
are passionate about, and that can change over time.

But given my interests and what I'm currently passionate about, you should not
be shocked if this blog gets filled up with topics ranging from the geekiest
programming hacks to the deepest philosophical questions.

I will be raw, honest and maybe even unpleasant. This is **my** space after all, 
and I'm not here to sell you anything. In fact, this blog is a tool for 
learning about myself through writing. Sharing it on the Internet is a bonus.

## Next time

Guess I gave you the boring story after all. Oh well. I'll cut this post short,
and will come back next time with some juicy details about the homemade software 
running this blog!
